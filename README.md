#### Note :

The given task required asked me to use Material UI to design the web app but due to my mid-semester exams (time constrains) I was not able to do so , thus I used the library which I am familiar with i.e. MDBootstrap.Although I am willing to learn Material-UI if company's day to day work requires so.
